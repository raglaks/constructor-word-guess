# constructor-word-guess
This was an advanced JavaScript assignment for my full-stack web development bootcamp. It's a Hangman clone that run in the terminal. It requires command-line user input. The specifications for the assignment required the use of JS constructers and Node modules such as inquirer. It is a command line application, so make sure you run `npm install` prior to attempting the game.
