# Command Line Hangman

This was an advanced JavaScript assignment for my full-stack web development bootcamp. It's a Hangman clone that runs in the terminal. It requires command-line user input to be played. 

The specifications for the assignment required the use of JS constructers and Node modules such as inquirer. Make sure you run `npm install` prior to attempting to play the game.

This assignment proved to be very useful for my JavaScript arsenal because of the `module.exports` and constructor functions requirements. I got to practice making objects with useful information by checking if a player had guessed the correct letter in the chosen word or not. 

String concatenation to correctly show the guessed letters, or underscores, was a persistently annoying bug that I tried to tackle for a few days. In the end, it was solved by simply taking a day off and not looking at the code for a full 24 hours. When I came back to the problem, I realized that I was checking for the wrong condition.
