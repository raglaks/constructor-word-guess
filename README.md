# constructor-word-guess

This was an advanced JavaScript assignment for my full-stack web development bootcamp. It's a Hangman clone that runs in the terminal. It requires command-line user input. 

The specifications for the assignment required the use of JS constructers and Node modules such as inquirer. Make sure you run `npm install` prior to attempting to play the game.
